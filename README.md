This project covers the making of a program to calculate prime pairs up to a number N. Inside CDDLabs/Prime Project/PrimePairs there is a make file targeting the main multiThreadPrimePair.cpp file to assist in building it. type "make" into the terminal to compile the file, then afterwards to run it with the system time enter "time ./multiThreadPrimePair" into the terminal. <br>
There are some other examples of better prime finding algorithms that were explored subsequently to the completion of this project that could be better implemented for future use <br>
